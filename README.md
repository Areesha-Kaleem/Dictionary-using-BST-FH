# Dictionary-using-BST-FH
I have created a comprehensive C++ program called the "GUI Dictionary Project" that utilizes Binary Search Tree (BST) and file handling to create an efficient dictionary application. The program allows users to load a dictionary from a .txt file, offers intelligent word suggestions, and enables effortless addition of new words to the dictionary.
